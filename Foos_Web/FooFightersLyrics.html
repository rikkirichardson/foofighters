	<blockquote>
		<pre>
		I've got another confession to make
		I'm your fool
		Everyone's got their chains to break
		Holdin' you

		Were you born to resist, or be abused?

		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?
		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?

		Or are you gone and onto someone new?

		I needed somewhere to hang my head
		Without your noose
		You gave me something that I didn't have
		But had no use
		I was too weak to give in
		Too strong to lose

		My heart is under arrest again
		But I'll break loose
		My head is giving me life or death
		But I can't choose
		I swear I'll never give in
		I refuse

		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?
		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?

		Has someone taken your faith?
		It's real, the pain you feel
		You trust, you must confess

		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?

		Has someone taken your faith?
		It's real, the pain you feel
		The life, the love
		You'd die to heal
		The hope that starts
		The broken hearts
		You trust, you must confess

		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?
		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?

		I've got another confession my friend
		I'm no fool
		I'm getting tired of starting again
		Somewhere new

		Were you born to resist, or be abused?
		I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?
		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?
		Has someone taken your faith?
		It's real, the pain you feel
		You trust, you must confess

		Is someone getting the best
		The best, the best, the best of you?

		<blockquote>
			<pre>
	Too alarming now, to talk about
	Take your pictures down, and shake it out
	Truth or consequence, say it aloud
	Use that evidence, race it around

	There goes my hero
	Watch him as he goes
	There goes my hero
	He's ordinary

	Don't the best of them bleed it out
	While the rest of them peter out
	Truth or consequence say it aloud
	Use that evidence race it around

	There goes my hero
	Watch him as he goes
	There goes my hero
	He's ordinary

	Kudos my hero
	Leaving all the best
	You got my hero
	One that's on

	There goes my hero
	Watch him as he goes
	There goes my hero
	He's ordinary

	There goes my hero
	Watch him as he goes
	There goes my hero
	He's ordinary
